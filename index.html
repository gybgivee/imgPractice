                        LaCie’s rugged external hard drives are a favorite among content
                        creators who are always out on the field. It’s drop, shock, dust,
                        and rain-resistant, making it ideal for surviving the elements

                        connectivity as well, with the Thunderbolt/USB-C option being
                        ideal for MacBook and Dell XPS users, and the RAID option being
                        perfect for creative professionals. Because it comes with up to

                    <h3>Seagate Backup Plus - The Best Performance</h3>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R-NATJTyzaE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p>
                        If you want to combine speed and capacity, then the Seagate Backup
                        Plus Desktop Drive 5TB is definitely worth considering. It comes
                        in a range of sizes up to 8TB and it beats the competition when it
                        comes to read and write speeds as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On top of this storage and speed, you get a decent amount of peace
                        of mind thanks to Seagate's lower than average failure rates,
                        especially in bigger capacity hard drives.

                    <h3>Samsung T5 SSD - The Best SSD</h3>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFT1iVn8mBg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p>
                        If you'd rather have an external hard drive that takes advantage
                        of solid state drive (SSD) speeds, then the Samsung Portable SSD
                        T5 is certainly among the best external hard drive for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Samsung has an excellent reputation for external SSDs, thanks to
                        products like the T3, and the T5 builds on its predecessor by
                        adding a fast USB Type-C connection that ekes out every last drop
                        of performance from the solid state drive inside. Of course, it's
                        also backwards compatible with USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 if your PC
                        doesn't have USB Type-C. Be prepared to shell out a bit more cash,
                        but it’s well worth it.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Buying the best external hard drive for your needs involves figuring
                    out how much space you need. You don't want to buy an external hard
                    drive that's too small, end up running out of space and buying
                    another one. However, you also don’t want to pay over the odds for
                    storage space you'll never need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, the best external hard drives must also be dependable
                    and rugged, so you can safely store your data without worry. The
                    best external drives must also be light enough to carry in your bag,
                    with large capacities so that you can keep your data safe when
                    traveling.
